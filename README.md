# Customer-Churn-Prediction
In this project, I aim to carry out classification tasks utilizing logistic regression and decision trees, algorithms and implement the popular data science pipeline known as OSEMN. My objective is to understand the relationship between the target and explanatory variables through data exploration, which will aid in the selection of features for building predictive models. I will then use these techniques to train a model to predict customer churn. Furthermore, I will compare the performance of logistic regression and decision trees as baseline models for better prediction.
